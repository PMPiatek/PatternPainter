# PatternPainter
Program created during a university course in 2015.

This program creates an image filled with a pattern generated by a mathematical formula. There are multiple patterns implemented, as well as option to apply blur to the image. The pattern can be drawn using 2 solid colors, by mixing 2 source images or by mixing a source image with a solid color.

The program is executed from command line with 13 arguments which are:
- 1 - name of destination file
- 2 - x resolution
- 3 - y resolution
- 4 - x scale
- 5 - y scale
- 6 - rotation (in degrees)
- 7 - x shear
- 8 - y shear
- 9 - HEX color or source image path (image can't be smaller than specified resolution)
- 10 - HEX color or source image path (image can't be smaller than specified resolution)
- 11 - pattern number [1-8]
- 12 - should blur be applied [true/false]
- 13 - iterations of blur
